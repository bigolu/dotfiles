A shell is either interactive or non-interactive and either login or non-login. This produces
four different 'modes': interactive-login, interactive-non-login, non-interactive-login,
and non-interactive-non-login. This file configures the shell appropriately
based on the mode it's running in.

DEFINITIONS:
######################################

non-interactive - a shell that is run without passing the --interactive flag. It's called
non-interactive since it runs commands from a script (e.g. 'fish path-to-script.fish')
or from a string containing commands (e.g. 'fish --command "echo hi"'). This is in contrast to
an interactive shell that gets its commands to run by prompting the user, like in a terminal.

interactive - a shell started with the --interactive flag (e.g. fish --interactive).
This type of shell prompts the user for commands to run. You can also give it a script to run
and the shell will become interactive after running the script
(e.g. 'fish --interactive path-to-script.fish').

login - A shell started with the --login flag. This flag is used so that the shell
can tell if it is being run as part of the login process. This way, the shell
can run commands that should only be run once at login (like setting environment variables).

non-login - A shell started without the --login flag.

EXAMPLES:
######################################

non-interactive-non-login mode - Used when running a script or one-off command.

non-interactive-login mode - This usually gets created by a display manager (e.g. gnome display manager)
after a user logs in through a GUI.

interactive-non-login mode - Used when a user launches a terminal.

interactive-login mode - This gets created when a user ssh's into a computer since the ssh developers
consider it a form of logging in.
