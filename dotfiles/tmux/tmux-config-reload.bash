# TODO: Ideally I would get my config file(s) straight from tmux with the command below, but the problem is that
# if my config file is a symlink, tmux will return the destination of the symlink and since I use nix to manage my
# config files, the destination of the symlink will change every time my nix generation changes. I should see if
# tmux would be willing to provide a way to get the symlink path instead of the destination path. In the meantime,
# I'll just hardcode it since it probably won't change anytime soon.
